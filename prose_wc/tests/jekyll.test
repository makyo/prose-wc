If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. And right there you got an almighty cloud. Sélène wants reflections, so let's give her reflections. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it.

Get tough with it, get strong. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here.

Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Let's do that again.

You can get away with a lot. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. The light is your friend. Preserve it. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way.

Let's have a nice tree right here. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Work that paint. We wash our brush with odorless thinner.

[Everybody](https://github.com) needs...a friend. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall.

This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. We can fix anything. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Take your time. Speed will come later. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens.
